        <p class="text_line">Leo Sandoli was born in Bolzano, Italy. </p>
         <p class="text_line">
At the age of 3, he fell in love with movies for their ability to take you to different worlds and to make the audience truly care about the emotions of a character. He soon started redrawing characters from his favorite movies and came up with his own simple stories.
In middle school, the subject that he was most passionate about was art, and later in High School Art History. That's when he decided that he wanted to pursue a creative career. </p>
 <p class="text_line">In 2022, after receiving a degree in Modern Languages at Walther von der Vogelweide, he moved to Milan where he started his creative studies.
In 2025, he graduated with a degree in Graphic design and Art direction from NABA Milano. </p>
<p class="text_line">In his work as a communication designer, Leo seeks engaging and emotional storytelling that is visually translated in a manner that impacts people. </p>
