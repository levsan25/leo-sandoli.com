<h2>It's getting late</h2>
<p class="intro">
Elton John is one of the most popular pop music artists which ever lived and she shaped this genre like few other's. Despite being well established among gen X and Baby Boomers, many people among Gen Z don't know the songs of this artist. This is when I decided that I wanted to pay tribute to this prolific artist who has created iconic songs as GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD, ROCKETMAN, BENNY AND THE JETS and I'M STILL STANDING. </p> 
<p class="intro"> For his 50th anniversary since his debut, I wanted to create a restyling of one of his old songs, all in a style that reflects the naive and nostalgic 70s vibe when the song first came out, but that at the same time meets the Graphic taste of the new generations.
