<h2>Two roads diverged...</h2>
<p class="intro">
<b>THE ROAD NOT TAKEN is a famous poem written by Robert Frost about life choices and the melancholy and uncertainty that can result from it. </b></p>
<p class="intro">Through this video which accompanies the beautiful and emotional lyrics of Robert Frost, I wanted to give my personal interpretation of it, mainly through images with nature as a protagonist seen from the perspective of a lonely traveller. Even though the images are mostly realistic, I tried to mantain a slight element of magic and timelessness throughout the video and to get the audience as immersed into the landscapes as I was while shooting them. 
We constantly find ourselves in front of divergent paths that might lead onto comnpletely different journeys.  </p>
<p class="intro">
<b>The important thing is not which path we choose but how we eventually go with it. </b></p>
